# Myn-Social (Fashion-Social Media) üõçÔ∏è

This project aims to enhance the Myntra website by introducing new features to boost user engagement, encourage user-generated content, and incorporate a reward system. These improvements are designed to make the shopping experience more interactive and social, especially for younger users.

## Problem Statement ‚ùì
- **Low User Engagement:** Shopping platforms aren't exciting enough for young users who prefer interactive and social features.
- **Lack of User-Generated Content:** Current platforms don't encourage users to share their fashion experiences, resulting in fewer reviews, photos, and videos.
- **Absence of Rewards System:** There's no system to reward users for their engagement, making them less likely to participate actively.
- **Few Social Features:** Existing platforms don't have enough social media functions for sharing and interacting.

## Solution üìù
### Personal Social Fashion Page
- **User Profiles:** Let users share their fashion experiences directly on their personal profile pages.
- **Shoppable Posts:** Allow users and influencers to create posts with shoppable links.
- **Product Tagging:** Every product within the profile will be interconnected to existing products on Myntra, or users can tag manually while posting a product snapshot.
- **User-Generated Content (UGC):** Provides social proof and allows users to see how items look on real people.

### Myntra Coins üëõ
- **Virtual Currency:** Coins are a virtual currency within our platform.
- **Reward System:** Incentivize users to actively participate and contribute to the platform.
- **Redeemable Rewards:** Users can redeem coins for discounts on their purchases, making their shopping experience more cost-effective.
- **Earning Coins:** Users earn coins via posting reviews, creating content, etc.
